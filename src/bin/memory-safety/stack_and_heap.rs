// * The STACK amd HEAP
//                 ? The STACK and heap are two different parts/region of the computer's memory...
//                 ? The STACK and heap are read and write data in different ways that offer advantages and disadvantages...

// *Stack:
//                 ? A stack stores values in the sequential order it receives them....
//                 ? A stack is last in, first out (lifo.)the last item added is the first one removed ...
//                 ?the technical terminology for adding data is pushing onto the stack ..
//                 ? the technical terminology for removing data is popping off the stack...

//                 ? all stack data has a fixed ,consistent size is known at compile time..
//                 & Data type like integers,floating-points,booleans,Characters, and arrays have a fixed size,Rust Stores them on the stack at runtime
//                 ? The pieces of data on the stack will not grow or shrink in size as the program runs...

// * Heap:
//                 ? the heap is a large area  of storage space. think  of it like a warehouse ...
//                 ? The heap is for data whose size is not known  at compiler time (user input ,a file's contents,etc..).
//                 ? When the Rust program  needs dynamic space , it requests it from  the heap .a program called the memory allocator finds an empty spot that is large enough to store the data....

//                 ? Allocating on the heap is slower than pushing to the stack . the memory allocator has to spend time searching for an open spot large enough to fit the data .....
//                 ? accessing data is faster on the stack than the heap as well . with a heap , the program has to follow the pointer to find the memory address..
//                 ?A stack stores the data in sequence ,so there is less "jumping around " from point to point.
