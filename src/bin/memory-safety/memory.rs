// * MEMORY :

            // ? Ownership is a set of rules that the compiler checks for to ensure the program will be free of memory errors

            // ? Memory refers to the area of your computer that is responsible for storing the information your programs use ....

            // ? it's ideal to free memory  when it is no longer in use ...

            // ? programming languages implement different strategies for memory management...

// *Manual Memory Management :
                        // ? in language like C and C++ ,the programmer is responsible for allocating (requesting memory ) and deallocating it (giving it back to the computer ).....

                        // ? Unfortunetely human beings make mistakes ....
                            // forgatting to deallocate memory that has been allocated 
                            // trying to deallocate memory that has already been deallocated..


// * Automation Garbage Collection :
                            // ? Languages like JAVA ,PYTHON ,RUBY and GO implement a tool called the garbage  collector ...
                            // ?the garbage collector looks for data that is no longer in use and deallocaters it. it "automates" the cleanup process
                            // ? the gabage collecter itself occupies memory and can run at disadvantagous times....
