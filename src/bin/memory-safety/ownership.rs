// * OWNERSHIP :
//                 ? Rust introduces a nes paradigm : OWNERSHIP ....
//                 ?Ownership is set of rules on hoe Rust manages your computers memory
//                 ? the rust compiler does not compile the program if an ownership rule is violated...
//                 ? Best of all workers : the speed of a languages like c but less room for errors ...

// * What is Ownership ??
//                 ?the owner is who/what is responsible for clearing up a piece of data when it is no longer in use ...
//                 ?every value in a rust program  has a owner ...
//                 ? the owner  can change over the course of program,,but there is only 1 owner for a value at a time....
//                 ? the owner is usually a name ....
//                 a variable can be an owner ..
//                 a parameter can be an owner ...

//                 ? ownership also extends to composite types that own their elements...

//                 a tuple and array own their values......

//                 ? the purpose of the ownership is to assign responsibility for deallocating memory (primarily heap memory)

//                 ? OWNERSHIP is a compiler features for reading for reducing duplicate heap data and cleaning up heap data that ino longer needed



// * Basics of Owndership:
//                 ? A scope is the boundary within a program where a name is valid..
//                 ? A scope ends when a block concludes .A block is a region of code created by pair of curly braces ...
//                 ? The owners cleans up its data when its name goes out of scope...


// * The copy trait:
//                 ? A trait is a contract that requires that a type support a functionality ...
//                 ? A type implements the copy trait if it can produce a duplicate of itself automatically in specific situations..
//                 ? When we assign one variable to another , Rust will make a full copy of the value of its type implements the copy traits
//                 ? Primitive values like integers ,float ,and booleans all implement the copy trait...
