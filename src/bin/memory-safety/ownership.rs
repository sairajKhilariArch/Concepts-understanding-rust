// * OWNERSHIP :
            // ? Rust introduces a nes paradigm : OWNERSHIP ....
            // ?Ownership is set of rules on hoe Rust manages your computers memory
            // ? the rust compiler does not compile the program if an ownership rule is voilated...
            // ? Best of all workers : the speed of a languages like c but less room for errors ...

// * What is Ownership ??
                // ?the owner is who/what is responsible for clearing up a piece of data when it is no longer in use ...
                // ?every value in a rust program  has a owner ...
                // ? the owner  can change over the course of program,,but there is only 1 owner for a value at a time....
                // ? the owner is usually a name ....
                // a variable can be an owner ..
                // a parameter can be an owner ...

                // ? ownership also extends to composite types that own their elements...

                // a tuple and array own their values......


                // ? the purpose of the ownership is to assign responsiblity for deallocating memory (primarily heap memory)

                // ? OWNERSHIP is a compiler features for reading for reducing duplicate heap data and cleaning up heap data that isno longer needed


// * The STACK amd HEAP
                // ? The STACK and heap are two different parts/region of the computer's memory...
                // ? The STACK and heap are read and write data in different ways that offer advantages and disadvantages...

// *Stack:
        // ? A stack stores values in the sequential order it receives them....
        // ? A stack is last in, first out (lifo.)the last item added is the first one removed ...
        // ?the technical terminology for adding data is pushing onto the stack ..
        // ? the technical terminology for removing data is popping off the stack...
        
        // ? all stack data has a fixed ,consistent siixe is known at compile time..
        // ? Data type like integers,floating-points,Blooleans,Characters, and arrays have a fixed size,Rust Stores them on the stack at runtime
        // ? The pieces of data on the stack will not grow or shrink in size as the program runs...

// * Heap:
        // ? the heap is a large area  of storage space. think  of it like a warehouse ...
        // ? The heap is for data whoose size is not known  at compiler time (user input ,a file's contents,etc..).
        // ? When the Rust program  needs dynamic space , it requests it from  the heap .a program called the memory allocator finds an empty spot that is large enough to store the data....


        // ? Allocating on the heap is slower than pushing to the stack . the memory allocator has to spend time searching for an open spot large enough to fit the data .....
        // ? accessing data is faster on the stack than the heap as well . with a heap , the program has to follow the pointer to find the memory address..
        // ?A stack stores the data in sequence ,so there is less "jumping around " from point to point.


// * Refrences:
        // ? the memory allocator returns a refrence , which is an address..
        // ? the refrence points to the memory address of the data
        // ? think of a parking  lot giving  you a refrence (spot"H25") when they park your car..
        // ? we can store a refrence  in a variable in  a rust program . Refrences have a fixed  size, so rust stores them on the stack...
