// * MEMORY :

//             ? Ownership is a set of rules that the compiler checks for to ensure the program will be free of memory errors

//             ? Memory refers to the area of your computer that is responsible for storing the information your programs use ....

//             ? it's ideal to free memory  when it is no longer in use ...

//             ? programming languages implement different strategies for memory management...

// *Manual Memory Management :
//                         ? in language like C and C++ ,the programmer is responsible for allocating (requesting memory ) and deallocating it (giving it back to the computer ).....

//                         ? Unfortunately human beings make mistakes ....
//                             forgetting to deallocate memory that has been allocated
//                             trying to deallocate memory that has already been deallocated..

// * Automation Garbage Collection :
//                             ? Languages like JAVA ,PYTHON ,RUBY and GO implement a tool called the garbage  collector ...
//                             ?the garbage collector looks for data that is no longer in use and deallocates it. it "automates" the cleanup process
//                             ? the garbage collector itself occupies memory and can run at disadvantageous times....
