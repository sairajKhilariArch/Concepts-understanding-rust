// * The str type :
//                  ? Rust has 2 core strings types...
//                  ? the first type is a string literal , also called a string slice .this is the str version..
//                  ? creates a string slice with a pair of double qotes and a hardcoded values ...
//                  ? String Literals are embedded directely into the binary ,the executable file that the rust compilers produces from our source code...


// * The String type 1:
//                  ? The String type lives on the heap and supports dynamic text . it can grow and shrink in size ...
//                  ? The String type does not implement the copy trait..
//                  ? therefore ,ownership moves from one owner to another when we assign a String to another variable or pass it into function..
